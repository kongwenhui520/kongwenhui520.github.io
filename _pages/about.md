I'm a Ph.D. candidate in cryptography at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) with the supversion of Prof. Xingjun Wang and the researcer fellow Ning Hu from Pengcheng Lab. Before the Ph.D phase, I received my master's degree in cybersecurity from the [University of Chinese Academy of Science](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) and the [Institute of Information Engineering](https://www.iie.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Science in 2022 under the supervision of the associate research fellow [Jianghua Zhong](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~jianghua) and the research fellow [Dongdai Lin](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~ddlin?language=en). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in mathematics from [Nanchang University](https://smcs.ncu.edu.cn/) in 2019.




I focus on theoretical cryptography, applied cryptography, and network security.
